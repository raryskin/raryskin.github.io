### Research

__How do humans understand each other?__ I study how individuals make sophisticated inferences, in real time, during communication in order to extract meaning from language input that can be noisy and ambiguous. I combine insights from eye-tracking, EEG, computational approaches, fieldwork, and neuropsychology to understand 1) how people use various sources of information (visuo-spatial perspective, the speaker's knowledge state, language statistics, etc.) to generate and constrain their linguistic predictions, and 2) how lifelong learning allows inferences to be adaptive when the environment changes. 


### Academic bio

I'm an Associate Professor of [Cognitive & Information Sciences](https://cogsci.ucmerced.edu) at the University of California, Merced. Check out the [Language, Interaction, & Cognition (LInC) lab](https://linclab0.github.io) webpage for more details!

Previously, I worked as a postdoc with [Ev Fedorenko](http://evlab.mit.edu/) and [Ted Gibson](http://tedlab.mit.edu/) in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT and [Swathi Kiran](http://www.bu.edu/aphasiaresearch/) in Speech, Language, and Hearing Science at Boston University. I got my PhD in Cognitive Psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I worked primarily with [Sarah Brown-Schmidt](http://sarahbrownschmidt.com/professional/) and [Aaron Benjamin](http://www.psych.illinois.edu/~asbenjam/). Before grad school, I got a B.A. in Cognitive Science from Northwestern University, where I studied memory for inaccurate information in text in [David Rapp](https://rapplab.sesp.northwestern.edu/index.html)'s lab and how verbal labels help children learn relational concepts in [Dedre Gentner](http://groups.psych.northwestern.edu/poct/)'s lab.
